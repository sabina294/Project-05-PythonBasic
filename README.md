# Python Setup

### 1. Install Python 3.13.5 from Source

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language used to build all kinds of software — from simple scripts to complex web applications and data analysis tools.
The current version I am using is python `v3.13.5`. To install or update to the latest version, open your preferred terminal and run the following commands:

```sh

#### Download and extract Python 3.13.5
```sh
cd /usr/src
sudo curl -O https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.5/Python-3.13.5.tgz
sudo tar xzf Python-3.13.5.tgz
cd Python-3.13.5

```
#### Set Python 3.13.5 as default python3 (optional)
```sh
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/local/bin/python3.13 1
sudo update-alternatives --config python3

```
